NAME
====

JSON::Unmarshal

Make JSON from an Object (the opposite of JSON::Marshal)

SYNOPSIS
========



    use JSON::Unmarshal;

    class SomeClass {
        has Str $.string;
        has Int $.int;
    }

    my $json = '{ "string" : "string", "int" : 42 }';

    my SomeClass $object = unmarshal($json, SomeClass);

    say $object.string; # -> "string"
    say $object.int;    # -> 42


Or explictly opt-in the attributes for deserialization:

    use JSON::Unmarshal;
    use JSON::OptIn;

    class SomeClass {
        has Str $.string  = "original";
        has Int $.int     is json;
    }

    my $json = '{ "string" : "string", "int" : 42 }';

    my SomeClass $object = unmarshal($json, SomeClass, :opt-in);

    say $object.string; # -> "original"
    say $object.int;    # -> 42


It is also possible to use a trait to control how the value is unmarshalled:

    use JSON::Unmarshal

    class SomeClass {
        has Version $.version is unmarshalled-by(-> $v { Version.new($v) });
    }

    my $json = '{ "version" : "0.0.1" }';

    my SomeClass $object = unmarshal($json, SomeClass);

    say $object.version; # -> "v0.0.1"

The trait has two variants, one which takes a Routine as above, the other a Str representing the name of a method that will be called on the type object of the attribute type (such as "new",) both are expected to take the value from the JSON as a single argument.

DESCRIPTION
===========

This provides a single exported subroutine to create an object from a JSON representation of an object.

It only initialises the "public" attributes (that is those with accessors created by declaring them with the '.' twigil.) Attributes without acccessors are ignored. By default *all* the public attributes present in the JSON will be initialised, which may not be ideal if you are accepting JSON from a source outside of your control (such as some http API,) and/or there are attributes which are lazily built from other other data:  if the `:opt-in` adverb is passed to `unmarshal` only those attributes marked explicitly with the `is json` trait (from `JSON::OptIn`,) or have the traits `json-name` ( from `JSON::Name`,) or `unmarshalled-by` will be initialised from the JSON.

It only initialises the "public" attributes (that is those with accessors created by declaring them with the '.' twigil. Attributes without acccessors are ignored.

INSTALLATION
============



Assuming you have a working Raku installation you should be able to install this with *zef* :

    # From the source directory

    zef install .

    # Remote installation

    zef install JSON::Unmarshal
